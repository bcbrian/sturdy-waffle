mawbster: Do you know the game where you
make a tower/castle with playing cards.
You could make an app game that does that
with waffles and have earthquakes or
animals or something that might knock em
down or maybe raining syrup that
amalgamates up on the top under weight
that you have to do something with to
keep it standing.
